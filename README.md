Market Basket Analysis with Groceries Dataset Using Apriori Algorithm for Association Rule Mining

Project Overview: This project explores Market Basket Analysis using the Groceries Dataset. Market Basket Analysis helps retail to discover association and patterns in customers' purchasing behaviour. The goal is to identify which items are frequently purchased together, show associations between products and to use this information in assisting businesses make strategic decisions.

Key Insights:

- Identified frequent itemsets using the Apriori algorithm.

- Generated association rules based on confidence and lift metrics.

- Explored relationships between products and customer purchasing habits.

Why Market Basket Analysis? Understanding which items customers tend to buy together can empower businesses to:

- Optimize product placements for increased visibility.

- Design targeted promotions to boost sales.

- Enhance cross-selling strategies to maximize revenue.

Data Source: The analysis is based on the Groceries Dataset; grocery transactions collected over a period of time, offering real-world view into customer choices.

Getting Started:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (Market_Basket_Analysis.ipynb) to explore the analysis.

2. Examine the Python code, comments, and visualizations to gain insights.

How to Use:

- Feel free to fork & clone the repository to run the analysis locally.

- Experiment with different parameters to customize the analysis for your dataset.

Dependencies:

- Python 3.x

- Libraries: pandas, mlxtend, matplotlib, seaborn

Acknowledgments: Massive thanks to the entire Coordinating team of the Data Analytics / Data Science Track on the FLiT Apprenticeship program for providing the dataset and tools that enable me to explore, push myself and learn. This project has given me a whole new perspective into retail sales, both online and offline. I walk into the supermarket or log into an online store and understand why certain products are placed close to eachother offline and certain items are suggested whilst shopping online for another.
